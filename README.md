# Maze-Solving-with-Genetic-Algorithms
This project demonstrates the application of a genetic algorithm to solve a maze. It utilizes the DEAP library for evolutionary computation and matplotlib for visualization. The algorithm evolves a population of potential paths through the maze, gradually improving their fitness until an optimal solution is found.
<ul><li>Utilized the DEAP library for evolutionary computation and explored it to solve a maze solver</li>
<li>Enhanced understanding of genetic algorithms, experimenting with various strategies in maze solving</li>
<li>Employed Matplotlib for visualizing complex routing solutions, facilitating effective data communication and decision-making.</li>
</ul>
