# Maze-Solving-with-Genetic-Algorithms
This project demonstrates the application of a genetic algorithm to solve a maze. It utilizes the DEAP library for evolutionary computation and matplotlib for visualization. The algorithm evolves a population of potential paths through the maze, gradually improving their fitness until an optimal solution is found.
